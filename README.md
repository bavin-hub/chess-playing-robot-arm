# About the project
A 5-dof non-holonomic articulated manipulator that plays chess one-on-one with human. A simple convolutional neural network that identifies the chess-coin type in every location of the board and converts it to Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation. Image subtraction algorithm the finds the location to perform pick-and-place operation. The computer vision stack runs inside a raspberry-pi 3b+ whereas the inverse kinematics as well as the pick-and-place stack runs inside arduino uno.
